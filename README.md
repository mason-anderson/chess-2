# Chess 2

chess 2 is a gui application that (will hopefully) let you play many chess-like games.
I want to let players make new peices and specify how they move.
Maybe even have an engine that evaluates with the new peices.

## Building and Running

To build you will need several things installed

- haskell and the `cabal` build system.
    this should pull in all the haskell dependancies like `monomer`
- the sdl library

then you simply run `cabal run`

## about making this

I play a lot of chess so i thought it would be fun to make my own version in my favourite language.
I was also inspired by memes on reddit.com/anarchychess where they made new funny rules and peices.

Using an uncommon library like monomer has made me appreciate stack overflow a lot more,
but i guess im better at reading documentation and other people's code now.
